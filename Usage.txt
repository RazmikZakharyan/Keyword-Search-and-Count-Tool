Setting up the enviorment

Step 1)have python3 and pip installed on the system.
Step 2)pip install -r requirements.txt

there needs to be 2 txt files in the folder 
websites.txt , answers.txt

websites.txt contents-- In the first line you need to type what you want to search for, you have 3 boolean search options here:  + | -
+ Concatenates words to detect pages using more than one specific key
| Shows all sites that contain either or both specified words in the query
- Used to avoid displaying results containing certain words

second line the keyword that you want to count
third line urls of the websites

so an example of websites.txt would be something like this

" I want to search for websites that include WBE and airports and count the number of times the keyword WBE appears."

WBE + airport
WBE
https://epam.com
https://amazon.com
...
...


after the script finishes executing the urls where the keyword was found will be displayed in the answers.txt file in the following format.

the keyword which you searched.
the url where the keyword was found and the number of occurences there.


keyword: WBE
url : https://example
number of occurrences: 2


if instead of the number you see "Blocked by firewall" it means that the website security feature blocked the request by most likely putting up a captcha and it won't be possible to get results from that website automatically with scraping.
